We spend our lives trying to separate what's real from what is ② <u>imaginary</u> or illusory. It's a survival technique. Yet when we enter a theatre or a cinema, or even when we turn on a television or a radio, or log on to a website, we perform a feat of mental acrobatics. We will ourselves to ③ <u>ignore</u> the curtains, ignore the fact that we're in a dark and crowded room with a sticky floor, ignore the fact that we're looking at shadows coming from a little box, ignore the fact that the people we see are actors pretending to be people they aren't-saying words written by someone else, and having ④ <u>adventures</u> with special effects that were manufactured in a computer. Instead, we allow ourselves to enter the world of the show, to ⑤ <u>believe</u> for a little while that we're flying through space, or riding the Hogwarts Express, or witnessing a furious battle, or watching real people falling in love.",

They were a huge attraction for country folks coming into town. [ <u>the like / rural life / not / food / we / sometimes / believe / everyone / ploughman's lunches / and / enjoy / with / led to / are / paradise / the / was</u> ]. For the most part the country folk's diet was poor and lacked vitamins and essential minerals such as zinc needed for good long-term health. Poor farm labourers on their infrequent visits to town went for a filling meal and a protein fix. This was affordable to them in the numerous oyster bars or stalls and they would eat as much as their bellies could stand either fresh ones or pickled in vinegar.",
