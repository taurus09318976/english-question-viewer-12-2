In such studies, ③ <u>the hand and arm movements of unborn children in the womb are recorded using ultrasound images</u>. Using this technique, it was shown that ④ <u>a clear preference for the movement of the right arm exists as early as 10 weeks after fertilization</u>. In this study, ultrasound images of 72 unborn children 10 weeks after fertilization were evaluated and 85% showed more movements of the right arm than the left. ⑤ <u>This number is already very close to the approximately 89.4% right-handers among adults</u>.",

The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but (A) [ <u>replaced / until the Romans / the scroll / with the codex / it wasn&apos;t / - or, as we call it now, the book - / reached its full potential / that the material</u> ].

            "text": "The transition from an oral culture, in which knowledge was handed down through stories, songs, and apprenticeships, to a literate one, based on the written word, was held back for centuries by the lack of suitable writing material. Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but (A) [ <u>replaced / until the Romans / the scroll / with the codex / it wasn't / — or, as we call it now, the book — / reached its full potential / that the material</u> ].

Most people will opt for the larger sum in thirteen months - where else will you find a monthly interest rate of 10 percent. A wise choice, since the interest will compensate you generously for any risks you face by waiting the extra few weeks. Second question: Would you prefer $1,000 today cash on the table or $1,100 in a month? If you think like most people, you&apos;ll take the $1,000 right away. This is amazing. In both cases, if you hold out for just a month longer, you get $100 more. In the first case, it&apos;s simple enough.

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, (A) [ <u>using / many countries / that is inherently limited / in supply, / as money / have preferred / gold, silver, or some other material</u> ]. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be &quot;backed up&quot; by gold.

            "text": "The big problem with money created by the government is that those who run the government always face the temptation to create more money and spend it.

For this reason, (A) [ <u>using / many countries / that is inherently limited / in supply, / as money / have preferred / gold, silver, or some other material</u> ]. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels.

The woman groaned softly, trying to gather her strength. Linda moved closer, sliding a hand under the woman&apos;s back. As the woman&apos;s eyes slowly opened, she reassured her softly, &quot;It&apos;s okay, just relax for a moment.&quot; Linda helped the woman sit up slowly, then guided her back to her seat.

In order to achieve perspective, you must make a number of observations. (A) [ <u>and dimension / on a flat surface / or objects / in real life / actually have / depth / the forms / that you draw</u> ]. As you view them and place their shapes and forms on a drawing surface, try to represent that depth to make the objects appear realistic and three-dimensional. Objects appear differently when (B) <u>view</u> from various positions. Because of this, it&apos;s important to establish the viewpoint, and stick with it.
