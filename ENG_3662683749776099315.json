            "text": "Michael, a vice president of a mid-sized IT company, was doing quite well and even had an IT consulting business on the side. However, he was no longer feeling as excited or ① <u>challenged</u> as he once had. As part of a leadership program, his coach, Eddie, asked him to reflect and write a several-page personal vision about the life he dreamed he might have in 10-15 years. Surprisingly, Michael's essay was all about a social ② <u>advocacy</u> movement in which he was involved. He mentioned nothing about his work, his ③ <u>relationships</u>, or himself. Eddie jokingly said that it was a great vision as long as Michael had a large trust fund. Michael laughed and explained that he had worked his way from a very rough neighborhood, without really knowing what he wanted.
