            "text": "Empirical studies of auditory imagery have often employed methods in which auditory feedback was deprived. The rationale for this approach lies in the idea that if musicians have access to stable sound representations and auditory ① <u>imagery</u>, then they may depend less on external acoustic feedback.

Sight-reading performances with the sound of a digital piano switched off did not lead to more errors; thus it was not ③ <u>necessary</u> for them to hear what they actually played.
