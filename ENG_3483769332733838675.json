And all translators arrive at their ① <u>interpretations</u> in dialogue with other people. The English poet Alexander Pope had pretty good Greek, but when he set about translating Homer's lliad in the early 18th century he was not on his own. He had Greek commentaries to refer to, and translations that had already been done in English, Latin, and French - and of course he had ② <u>dictionaries</u>. Translators always draw on more than one source text. Even when the scene of ③ <u>translation</u> consists of just one person with a pen, paper, and the book that is being translated, or even when it is just one person translating orally for another, that person's ④ <u>linguistic</u> knowledge arises from lots of other texts and other conversations. And then his or her idea of the translation's purpose will be influenced by the ⑤ <u>changes</u> of the person or people it is for. In both these senses every translation is a crowd translation.",

Suddenly, the phone that was your lifeline a year ago is now a museum piece, unable to keep pace with your digital demands. And thus, the itch to upgrade begins, often before there&apos;s a genuine need. This cycle isn&apos;t just confined to our digital companions. It spills over into almost every aspect of consumer electronics, from the self-driving car to the smart fridge. Every product seems to be on a(an) (A) <b>[ stoppable / unstoppable ]</b> march towards the next version, the next generation that promises to (B) <b>[ generalize / revolutionize ]</b> your life. What&apos;s fascinating, or perhaps disturbing, is the utter efficacy of this cycle in shaping our desires. It&apos;s not so much that we want the newest device; we&apos;re led to believe we need it. The distinction between want and need blurs, shifting our financial priorities in favor of staying current with trends.

He had Greek commentaries to refer to, and translations that had already been done in English, Latin, and French - and of course he had dictionaries. Translators always draw on more than one source text. Even when the scene of translation consists of just one person with a pen, paper, and the book that is being translated, or even when it is just one person translating orally for another, that person&apos;s linguistic knowledge arises from lots of other texts and other conversations.

            "text": "All translators feel some pressure from the community of readers for whom they are doing their work. And all translators arrive at their interpretations in dialogue with other people. The English poet Alexander Pope had pretty good Greek, but when he set about translating Homer's lliad in the early 18th century he was not on his own. He had Greek commentaries to refer to, and translations that had already been done in English, Latin, and French - and of course he had dictionaries. Translators always draw on more than one source text. Even when the scene of translation consists of just one person with a pen, paper, and the book that is being translated, or even when it is just one person translating orally for another, that person's linguistic knowledge arises from lots of other texts and other conversations. And then [ <u>people / his or her / the / purpose / influence / the expectations of / or / the person / by / will / translation's / idea of</u> ] it is for. In both these senses every translation is a crowd translation.",
