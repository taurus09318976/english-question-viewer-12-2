This geographic, economic, and political clustering is mirrored in a similar clustering in our media environments. Fragmentation of the media, including television, spawned niche genres. In turn, these specific segments of mass media produced audiences that can more easily remain within their own sphere of comfort. Television's evolution, including the development of cable and satellite, has contributed to a withering notion of the \"commons,\" or the common good, and its replacement with social isolation primarily based on interests of the individual. Television has, to a significant degree, moved from promoting the commonalities among us to reinforcing our disagreements by targeting smaller groups and differing interests. This transition discourages the recognition of common problems or collective action, posing a fundamental threat to a democratic society.",

Stephen Dubner and his guests focused on cities and infrastructure rather than personal habits, but the principle of discounting the future ② <u>applies</u> equally. Politicians, as Dubner&apos;s guest, economist and cities expert Edward Glaeser, pointed out, ③ <u>are motivated</u> to limit spending in the present, while society benefits from today&apos;s investments that support communities into the future. Ironically, governments in ancient Rome, investing extensively and wisely in building and maintaining the vital systems ④ <u>upon which</u> communities depend, fell prey less often to temporal discounting than modern cities and states.

The answer is to pour in twenty-nine liters, and then remove three liters, three times.

In one puzzle, he asked subjects how to fill a bucket of water using only jars of specific volumes. For example, a puzzle might ask a subject to obtain twenty liters of water, using only a twenty-nine-liter jar and a three-liter jar. The answer is to pour in twenty-nine liters, and then remove three liters, three times. For these puzzles, Luchins presented a sequence of problems that could all be solved by repeating a pattern of adding the second jar, and removing the first jar and two times the third jar. Following multiple repetitions of this pattern, he then gave subjects a puzzle that could be solved with the more complicated pattern they had learned (that is, B - A - 2C ) or with a simpler solution (A - C). In their initial experiment, none of the subjects noticed the simpler solution.

The disadvantage of this approach is that if the goalkeeper guesses correctly which direction to dive, they have a reasonable chance of stopping the shot. However, there are a few players in the English Premiership who have developed a rather different penalty-taking technique. They run only slowly up to the penalty spot and then take an almost vertical leap into the air in their final stride before landing and aiming the ball almost accurately away from the goalkeeper&apos;s dive. The hard landing produces a strong enhanced pendulum action that helps power the kick, but it does not make their shots more powerful than conventional penalty takers. The advantage is that with a slower, more controlled approach, these strikers can keep their eyes on the goalkeeper for far longer, and only decide which direction to kick the ball after the goalkeeper has started to move. The technique requires massive skill but can result in success rates of over 90 percent.</span></div>",

            "text": "Many parents are very ① <u>attentive</u> to signs of depression, but they make the mistake of believing that childhood and adolescent depression appears the same as adult depression. Adults who are particularly sad or depressed tend to have sleep disturbances, become ② <u>withdrawn</u>, lack energy, seem to have a lower capacity to experience pleasure, and often express hopelessness. This is true of some children and adolescents, but nearly half of adolescents who are depressed are ③ <u>irritable</u> instead of withdrawn. They may have boundless energy and are likely to act out with rage. I have taken care of many depressed teenagers whose parents are loving and attentive but missed their child's depression because it is sometimes difficult for parents to tell a normal teenager from a depressed one. Normal teenagers have phases where they're irritable at home and have occasional ④ <u>outrageous</u> outbursts. Because parents may have adjusted to this moodiness, they can miss a teen whose rage and irritability are signals of emotional ⑤ <u>relief</u> or depression. This is a critical reason that parents need to feel comfortable turning to a professional for an evaluation.",

            "text": "The most popular and celebrated spectacle at Harbin Polarland is the Beluga whale display, in which the world-famous Mila and Nicola perform with their female trainers. In July 2009, 26-year-old Yang Yun entered a competition to become one of these trainers and was among the seven finalists. She couldn't wait to demonstrate her skills and prove she would be the best competitor to work with the two Belugas. When it was her turn to free-dive into the Arctic pool without any breathing equipment, Yang Yun quickly plunged herself into the icy depths but was horrified that she couldn't feel her legs. She had dived too deep, where the water pressure and the freezing temperatures had effectively paralyzed them. She could not swim to the surface and began to sink further down. She felt sure she would die there very soon. But, suddenly, she felt what she called \"an incredible force\" pushing her to the surface. She had no idea what had happened, but Mila, the Beluga whale, must have sensed Yang Yun's desperation. She had grasped hold of one of the young woman's legs and dragged her to safety even before event organizers realized poor Yang Yun was in distress. They weren't shocked; Mila had worked closely with humans for many years and had developed an understanding and sensitivity towards her trainers. Because Beluga whales have small teeth that are not sharp, Yang Yun's leg was completely unharmed. After being checked over by doctors, Yang Yun was given a clean bill of health, but she knew she was fortunate to have survived the whole experience without any injury. _______________ As the pool was monitored with cameras, the whole rescue was captured on film to document an astonishing example of an animal coming to the aid of a desperate human.
