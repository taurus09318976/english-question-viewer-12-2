But that imaginative transition - from imagining the lightning strike to imagining the flames - doesn't come from nowhere. Kevin's factual beliefs (that lightning is (c) <b>[ extreme / extremely ]</b> hot and that trees are wood and hence flammable) guide his imagination from one imagining to the next. If he didn't have these factual beliefs about lightning and trees, his imaginings wouldn't (d) <b>[ unfold / have unfolded ]</b> in that fashion. Thus, factual beliefs govern inferential transitions among imaginings (as well as other secondary cognitive attitudes). Otherwise put, the information stored in a person's factual beliefs guides (e) <b>[ how / what ]</b> that person's imaginings unfold; (f) <b>[ it / which ]</b> does the same for other cognitive attitudes. Importantly, imaginings don't do the same for factual beliefs, and this lack of symmetry is a defining contrast.",
