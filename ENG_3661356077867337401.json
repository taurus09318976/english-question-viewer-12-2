There will be times when, despite your best efforts, you may find yourself getting baited into an argument, pulled into a game, or ② <u>sucked</u> into an agenda. And since we can't always avoid these hot zones, we need to have strategies in place to handle them. How can we manage those specific situations: the daily ③ <u>benefits</u> and problems that arise at work, school, or with our family and friends? Despite Newton's theory, not every action needs a reaction. Just because someone is demanding your attention doesn't mean you have to give it, especially if that engagement seems emotionally ④ <u>charged</u>. When you decide not to dignify an irrational communication with a response, it's about preserving your personal ⑤ <u>dignity</u> and mental clarity. Just because someone throws the ball doesn't mean you have to catch it.",
