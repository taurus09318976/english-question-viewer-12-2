(A)__________ revenge bedtime procrastinators know the tips and tricks for better sleep and still choose to stay up. As one bedtime procrastinator put it, &quot;It&apos;s a way of revolting against all the obligations that you have. Because, well, my life, and I think the life of most adults, consists of lots and lots of obligations.&quot; These procrastinators are simply reclaiming freedom via one of the only outlets they have. We don&apos;t need a reminder to put down our phone before bedtime. We need space to make choices for ourselves. We need to exercise the basic human need to decide our own destiny. If you relate to the bedtime procrastinator, you&apos;re not alone. In our survey, 63% of people agreed they sometimes do things that are bad for them just to feel like they&apos;re in control. (B)__________, the next time you find yourself scrolling rather than sleeping, realize that part of the reason you&apos;re doing so is that you want to feel free to choose.</span></div>",

(A)__________ revenge bedtime procrastinators know the tips and tricks for better sleep and still choose to stay up. As one bedtime procrastinator put it, \"It's a way of revolting against all the obligations that you have. Because, well, my life, and I think the life of most adults, consists of lots and lots of obligations.\" These procrastinators are simply reclaiming freedom via one of the only outlets they have. We don't need a reminder to put down our phone before bedtime. We need space to make choices for ourselves. We need to exercise the basic human need to decide our own destiny.
