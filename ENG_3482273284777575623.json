When he was young, he eagerly awaited the weekly arrival of Life magazine and discussed the photographs the magazine contained with his father. Believing that he would have better career prospects, Kirkland moved to the United States after graduating from high school and found work at a photography studio. When Look magazine hired him at age 24 , he became their second-youngest photographer ever. His photos taken of Marilyn Monroe in 1961 became iconic almost instantly.
