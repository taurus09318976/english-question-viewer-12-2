As researchers try to fix the problem, counterexamples accumulate. Consequently, the field enters a state of crisis. The typical way out of this quagmire is the development of a fresh start, equipped with a host of novel tools and concepts. As the new framework rapidly establishes itself and makes progress, outdated questions and ideas are set aside and, eventually, they are forgotten. When this happens, when an older paradigm is replaced by a newer one, we have what Kuhn calls a scientific revolution. The new paradigm eventually crystallizes into normal science, adopting a consensus-building role, producing fresh anomalies, which eventually trigger a crisis, followed by another revolution, and so on, in a continuous cycle.",
