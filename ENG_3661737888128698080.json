(②) More important, though, it makes it possible for other scientists to use that data to construct new hypotheses and perform new experiments. (③) The assumption is that society as a whole will end up knowing more if information is spread as widely as possible, rather than being limited to a few people.

If we are in the water, with our head out in the air, there is no diving reflex. But if we sink just our face in a bowl of water, while the whole of the rest of our body is in the dry air, the diving reflex is triggered. It automatically closes down the airway, reducing the risk of swallowing water, and it narrows the small airpassages in the lungs. At the same time the heart rate is slowed down to half speed and blood is shunted to the vital organs, protecting them from __________. By contrast, if a chimpanzee or a gorilla found itself in water with its face below the surface, it would panic, its heart would race and it would quickly drown.",
