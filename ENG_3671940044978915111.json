The experience of learning about ethics can be frustrating for students who expect to walk out of class armed with clear-cut answers for how to deal with different types of problems. But in fact, such direct answers are rare in ethics. Instead, ethics is concerned with asking the right questions. The focus is on the quality of the deliberative process and not on the outcome. This can be discomforting because so much of Western culture is goal oriented. We care deeply about good performance, about results, about the bottom line - often with only passing interest in how we achieve those goals or what we do to attain &quot;success.&quot; But expecting ethics to provide the necessary &quot;correct&quot; answers usually just leads to moralizing - making broad, often unsubstantiated claims about a course of action that some will accept as reflecting their moral beliefs and others won&apos;t. Most ethical dilemmas don&apos;t present any fully acceptable solutions and instead offer several options that are unsatisfactory in some way. The trick is to figure out which one is most justifiable as you see it and which embodies key values.</span></div>",

But undoubtedly some portion involves deliberate, conscious, controlled responses by the self, and that portion may be ④ <u>disproportionately</u> important to the long-term health, happiness, and success of the individual. Even if it were shown that 95\\% of behavior consisted of lawful, predictable responses to situational stimuli by automatic processes, psychology could not afford to ignore the remaining 5%. As an analogy, cars are probably driven straight ahead at least 95% of the time, but ignoring the other 5% (such as by building cars without steering wheels) would seriously ⑤ <u>compromise]</u>the car's ability to reach most destinations. By the same token, the relatively few active, controlling choices by the self greatly increase the self's chances of achieving its goals. And if those few \"steering\" choices by the self are important, then so is whatever internal structure of the self is responsible for it.",
