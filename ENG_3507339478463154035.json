In this sense, mental development consists of internalizing social patterns and gradually becoming a (b) <u>responsible</u> actor among other responsible actors. In Denmark, the age of criminal responsibility is 15 years, which means that we then say that people have developed sufficient mental maturity to be accountable for their actions at this point. And at the age of 18 people are given the right to vote and are thereby formally (c) <u>excluded in</u> the basic democratic process. I do not know whether these age boundaries are optimal, but it is clear that mental development takes place at different rates for (d) <u>different</u> individuals, and depends especially on the social and family environment they have been given.

With each person who grasped the solar system view, it became easier for the next person to do so. So it is with the notion that the world revolves around the human economy. This is slowly being replaced by the view that the economy is a part of the larger system of material flows that connect all living things. When this perspective shifts into place, it will be obvious that our economic well-being requires that we account for, and respond to, factors of ecological health. Unfortunately we do not have a century or two to make the change.

            "text": "One well-known shift took place when the accepted view — that the Earth was the center of the universe — changed to one where we understood that we are only inhabitants on one planet orbiting the Sun. With each person who grasped the solar system view, it became easier for the next person to do so. So it is with the notion that the world revolves around the human economy. This is slowly being replaced by the view that the economy is a part of the larger system of material flows that connect all living things. When this perspective shifts into place, it will be obvious that our economic well-being requires that we account for, and respond to, factors of ecological health. Unfortunately we do not have a century or two to make the change.

The further you progress toward mastery, the less conscious awareness you often have of the fundamentals. Experiments show that skilled golfers and wine aficionados have a hard time describing their putting and tasting techniques - even asking them to explain their approaches is enough to interfere with their performance, so they often stay on autopilot. When I first saw an elite diver do four and a half somersaults, I asked how he managed to spin so fast.

            "text": "It's often said that those who can't do, teach. It would be more accurate to say that those who can do, can't teach the basics. A great deal of expert knowledge is implicit, not explicit. The further you progress toward mastery, the less conscious awareness you often have of the fundamentals. Experiments show that skilled golfers and wine aficionados have a hard time describing their putting and tasting techniques — even asking them to explain their approaches is enough to interfere with their performance, so they often stay on autopilot. When I first saw an elite diver do four and a half somersaults, I asked how he managed to spin so fast. His answer: \"Just go up in a ball.\" Experts often have an intuitive understanding of a route, but they struggle to clearly express all the steps to take. Their brain dump is partially filled with garbage.",

When I finally went to the school, his teacher told me that the sale had ended but that the library had saved the book for my little boy. I suspected the teacher had paid for it out of his own pocket. It was a story-board book with a place for a photo.

In the case of science, however, opinions differ. Some scientists, like the great biologist J. B. S. Haldane, see science in a similar light - as a historical activity that occurs in a particular time and place, and that needs to be understood within that context.

Compare, for example, a computer algorithm with the waggle dance of the honeybee, by which means a foraging bee conveys to others in the hive information about the source of food (such as nectar) it has located. The &quot;dance&quot; - a series of stylized movements on the comb - shows the bees how far away the food is and in which direction. But this input does not simply program other bees to go out and look for it. Rather, they evaluate this information, comparing it with their own knowledge of the surroundings. Some bees might not bother to make the journey, considering it not worthwhile. The input, such as it is, is processed in the light of the organism&apos;s own internal states and history; there is nothing prescriptive about its effects.</span></div>",

But his Grade 1 teacher was a wonderful, caring person who took the time to ask why Benjamin behaved the way he did. The teacher was determined to understand Benjamin and to accept him as he was. One day he came home with a note from his teacher. He suggested I go to the school library. They were having a sale, and he thought my son would like one of the books. I couldn&apos;t go for a couple of days and was concerned I&apos;d missed the opportunity. When I finally went to the school, his teacher told me that the sale had ended but that the library had saved the book for my little boy. I suspected the teacher had paid for it out of his own pocket. It was a story-board book with a place for a photo. On each page there was an outline of an animal and a hole so that the face in the photo appeared to be the face of the animal. Wondering if Benjamin would really be interested in the book, I brought it home. He loved it!
