            "text": "A few days after we arrived in the United States from China, my husband started working at a research institute at New York University. I called him to say I was going to take the subway alone to see him. The New York Metro was complicated, and since I couldn't speak English very well, I felt a little anxious, but I decided to take the subway anyway. I boarded the subway in the direction of New York University. <u>지하철에서 내렸을 때 낯선 역을 둘러보았다</u>. Uneasy thoughts suddenly filled my head. I lingered in the subway station for a long time before I finally realized that I had gotten off one stop early. Luckily, I hadn't left the station. I reboarded the subway and soon arrived at my destination. When I got off the subway again, I hummed as I happily walked toward the research institute where he worked. I saw my husband walking toward me, waving his hands to get my attention, and my tension melted away.",
