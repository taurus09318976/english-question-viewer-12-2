The station had traditional ticket offices with staff before, but these have been replaced with ticket vending machines. However, individuals who are unfamiliar with these machines are now experiencing difficulty accessing railway services. Since these individuals heavily relied on staff assistance to travel, they are in great need of ticket offices with staff in the station. Therefore, I urge you to consider reopening the ticket offices. With the staff back in their positions, many people would regain access to railway services. I look forward to your prompt attention to this matter and a positive resolution. Sincerely, Sarah Roberts.</span></div>",

History has many examples of scientists who searched fruitlessly for an essence because they used the wrong concept to guide their hypotheses. Firestein gives the example of luminiferous ether, a mysterious substance that was thought to fill the universe so that light would have a medium to move through. The ether was a black cat, writes Firestein, and physicists had been theorizing in a dark room, and then experimenting in it, looking for evidence of a cat that did not exist.",
