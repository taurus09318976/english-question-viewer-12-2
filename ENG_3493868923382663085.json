Today was going to be another perfect day until he ran into Mr. Kapoor, his science teacher. &quot;Just to remind you. Science fair projects are due next Wednesday.

After school, he came home worrying that his whole perfectly planned week was going to (b) <u>being ruined</u>. Without his usual greeting, Max headed to his room in haste. &quot;What&apos;s wrong Max?,&quot; Jeremy, his dad, followed Max, worrying about him. Max furiously browsed through his planner without answering him, only to find the wrong date written in it.

The animal&apos;s preference for being in one place or another is measured both before and after its experiences in the two places. If there is a shift in where the animal chooses to spend its time for the reward, this suggests that it liked the experience and is trying to repeat it. Conversely, if it now avoids the place the stimulus appeared and starts to prefer the place it did not experience it, then this suggests that it found the stimulus unpleasant.

            "text": "To be mathematically literate means to be able to think critically about societal issues on which mathematics has bearing so as to make informed decisions about how to solve these problems. Dealing with such complex problems through interdisciplinary approaches, mirroring real-world problems requires innovative ways of planning and organizing mathematical teaching methods. Navigating our world means being able to quantify, measure, estimate, classify, compare, find patterns, conjecture, justify, prove, and generalize within critical thinking and when using critical thinking.

Max thought for a moment. \"I guess.... I can do that by rescheduling tonight's baseball lesson.\" Jeremy beamed. \"See? That's you finding a solution.\" Max felt a genuine smile spreading.
