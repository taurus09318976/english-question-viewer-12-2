Human beings have created a comfortable and stable environment like a palace for themselves. However, in such a more stable environment, social division of labor, which is the motive force of inertia, will lead to a single and simple behavior habit in the functional unit of society. The individual may gradually lose its independent personality as a complete biological body and—just like an organ of the body—cannot live independently without the collective group. This will be a great challenge to our ideals, perceptions and values as an independent and free person. Human beings have achieved infinite success in the process of population expansion, competition with other species, and struggle with nature, but we have lost our individual selves as a result.",

            "text": "What is time? Here is a concept we all think we understand, and one that physics requires. Yet both ordinary folk and physicists would be hard-pressed to tell us what exactly time is. Notice that to define time in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds is to mistake the units of time for what they measure. It would be like defining space in terms of meters or yards. (A) Space is measured with equal accuracy in meters or yards. (B) But suppose we ask which is the correct way of measuring space?

These were records of children who should be students, but they weren't student records — they didn't record individual attendance or achievement. The need for individual records changed, however, once states passed compulsory school laws that required all children of a certain age to attend. Now schools were increasingly expected to maintain common sets of records that allowed information to be transferred from school to school in order to keep track of students and verify that families were complying with school laws. In addition to being good for record-keeping, the practice was intended to thwart an excuse common among youth stopped by truant officers: they weren't absent, they were simply crossing town to the school where they were enrolled. A quick check of a school's records could determine the truth of the claim — and whether the student's family would be issued a warning or worse.",

The reason for this can be purely practical, to squeeze in as much information as possible into a pricey 30-second commercial slot. Sometimes, when the taped commercial runs slightly over the allotted time, it&apos;s compressed to fit in, so it runs faster than actual life.

To create means having the ability to get excited and think, learn, remember, imagine, and all these are brain functions ① <u>whose</u> processing is distributed in areas, neural systems, and specific networks ② <u>functioning</u> within codes of time, not space. Creativity is an important ingredient in any artistic activity. It is the capacity to do new things, therefore, ③ <u>that</u> enables the artist to capture on canvas, wood, rock, or holograms feelings, abstracts, and ideals. It has been ④ <u>speculated</u> that the artistic creativity may emerge from that clash between the abstractions created by the brain, with its emotional component, unique and personal, and the concrete sensory objects of the world from which precisely those same abstractions have been constructed.

She stops and looks at me as if to say, &quot;No sign of the little dog here.&quot; Puz leads us to a back door, signaling me to go out. &quot;There is no way he could have gone out this way,&quot; the young woman says. I ask her to stay inside not to distract Puz. My golden retriever stretches toward some tall bushes, and from beneath them, a small black dog slides toward her, whimpering and dragging his legs.
