Natural environments decrease stress. Cortisol levels of people living in neighbourhoods with more green space were lower than in people in areas with little green space. In fact, as the percentage of green space in neighbourhoods increased, reported levels of stress decreased. Exposure to nature for thirty minutes over the course of a week reduced blood pressure, and ninety minutes of walking in nature, compared to a walk in an urban environment, reduced activity in brain areas involved with sadness and negative emotions. There is a trickle-down effect of having safe and accessible green space: people are likely to make use of it to move, exercise, and play if it is well maintained and easy to access.

            "text": "One area in which nature exposure is strongly connected to our wellbeing is our stress response. Natural environments decrease stress. Cortisol levels of people living in neighbourhoods with more green space were lower than in people in areas with little green space. In fact, as the percentage of green space in neighbourhoods increased, reported levels of stress decreased.

Free recall tests, in which students need to recall as much as they can remember without ③ <u>prompting</u>, tend to result in better retention than cued recall tests, in which students are given hints about what they need to remember. Cued recall tests, in turn, are better than recognition tests, such as multiple-choice answers, where the correct answer needs to be recognized but not ④ <u>generated</u>.
