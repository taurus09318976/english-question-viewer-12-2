The station had traditional ticket offices with staff before, but these have been replaced with ticket vending machines. However, <u>individuals who are unfamiliar with these machines are now experiencing difficulty accessing railway services</u>. Since these individuals heavily relied on staff assistance to travel, they are in great need of ticket offices with staff in the station. Therefore, I urge you to consider reopening the ticket offices. With the staff back in their positions, many people would regain access to railway services. I look forward to your prompt attention to this matter and a positive resolution. Sincerely, Sarah Roberts.</span></div>",
